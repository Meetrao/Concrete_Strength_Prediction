# Concrete_Strength_Prediction

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and age. Using machine learning techniques, particularly Linear Regression, the goal is to understand the relationships between various input features and the resulting strength of the concrete.

Dataset

The dataset contains 1030 observations and includes the following features:
	•	cement: Amount of cement (kg) in the mixture.
	•	slag: Amount of blast furnace slag (kg).
	•	ash: Amount of fly ash (kg).
	•	water: Quantity of water (kg).
	•	superplastic: Amount of superplasticizer (kg).
	•	coarseagg: Coarse aggregate content (kg).
	•	fineagg: Fine aggregate content (kg).
	•	age: Age of the concrete (days).
	•	strength (target): Compressive strength of the concrete (MPa).

Workflow

	1.	Data Loading
	•	Imported the dataset and libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Analyzed feature distributions using visualizations.
	•	Identified potential correlations between features.
	3.	Data Preprocessing
	•	Split the data into training and testing sets.
	•	Standardized the features for consistency.
	4.	Model Building
	•	Used Linear Regression to predict compressive strength.
	5.	Evaluation
	•	Evaluated model performance using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Results

	•	R² Score: Measures how well the model explains variance in the data.
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

Technologies Used

	•	Python
	•	Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

How to Run

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Concrete-Strength-Prediction.git  


	2.	Navigate to the project directory.
	3.	Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (ConcreteStrength.ipynb).

Future Improvements

	•	Explore non-linear regression models like Decision Trees or Random Forests.
	•	Perform feature engineering to identify additional influential factors.
